This is a very forgiving dress! It's form fitting without making you feel like you're squeezed into it.  I would rent this one again.  Highly recommend!\",\n",

I wore it to a black tie NYE wedding, and even though it was short, I felt like the fabric, fit, and the way it sparkled made it fit in just fine with the other formal gowns.  I usually wear a 6 or an 8 in dresses.  I ordered a 4 and a 6, and true to other reviewers' comments, the 4 fit me very well.  The chest area was just a tad loose, but that typically happens when I try on dresses...nothing a more padded bra couldn't fix!  The cut and fit were very figure flattering.  By the end of the evening I experience a little chafing under my arms from the sequins, but that was after 5 hours and it was very minor.

I had originally rented an 8 and 10 and when I saw that the straps were quite long (make sure you wear them criss-crossed), I contacted the RTR customer service who suggested sizing down. I did that and ended up wearing the 6. It fit great. I wore a backless sticky bra and was good all day! The top is fitted, so that helped to keep everything still while I was on the dance floor, too. The dress was casual enough for a daytime, outdoor ceremony, but also dressy enough for the party. The material is heavy and elegant - I received compliments all day long! I have bigger hips and was still able to size down due to the full skirt. I would recommend that instead of sizing up where you may be inadvertently showing more side boob than you might want! Lastly, I wore the Tova Blue Mohawk earrings which seem like they were made for this dress. Compliments on those as well. I can always count on RTR to make me look like a million bucks!',\n",

I had my daughter with me and the times i had to squat down to put her in her car seat i had to be cautious not to flash anyone, but you can avoid that situation pretty easily.  between the top and the skirt there is a thick seem, but for me it was fine. for others that have a thicker torso it might be tight. got lots of complements!\",\n",

It did not disappoint. I fluctuate between a 2 and 4 depending on the brand so got both sizes and went with the 2. The differences between the two were very subtle, I just preferred the smaller size since it was more fitted up top and I liked where the skirt fell lengthwise. It ran pretty true to size, but I thought the skirt fell longer than it appeared in the photo (and I'm 5 foot 6 so I normally don't have issues with length), but I didn't think it took away from the look at all. It was super comfortable which is high on my list, it was really fun to dance in, and was very unique in comparison to other guests at the winter wedding I wore it to. It's a great rental - you won't regret it!\",\n",

I have an athletic body, longer torso, shorter legs. \\n\\nRE: FIT/STRETCH. Because there is no stretch it this at all, this fits true to size. So, if you are a 4/6 girl (like me), order the 6. Whereas, if you\\'re a 4/6 girl and you\\'ve been watching those sweets for a couple weeks, then you\\'ll be able to wear the 4.  I ordered both!  I was worried I wouldn\\'t be able to sit in this, but I was able to sit just fine, in both the 4 and 6.  I was \"worried\" that the sleeves wouldn\\'t fit my arms (I do back/bi and chest/tri every week), yet the sleeves were fit perfectly!\\n\\nRE: LENGTH/SEXINESS. I felt that the dress was appropriately long. By today\\'s trends, most gals would say it\\'s way too long. And in fact, it would probably be too long for a petite woman. However, for my Bridal Shower, it really made a lovely statement, by being sexy (with it\\'s illusion top and glittery \"burnt\" rose gold) without being too sexy (appropriate length, covered chest).  From the pictures, you can tell that I am very, very, very pale. The illusion netting was a different color from my skin, but I didn\\'t mind one bit. If that\\'s a concern of yours, you can always wear panty hose to match. \\n\\nRE: ACCESSORIES: I wore dainty drop pink pearl earrings and matching bracelet and my engagement ring. My shoes were plain nude peep-toe pumps.\\n',\n",

I rented the 6 and 4 (per other reviewers recommendations) and I am glad I did because I wore the 4. The 6 fit and I could have worn it... but when I tried on the 4 \"just in case\" I instantly felt it fit me better. My only problem was I felt the empire cut under the breasts didn\\'t allow much room for busty women. But I was able to squeeze my D\\'s in there and not worry about them falling out. The material was lovely and packed well for my trip from Dallas to Seattle for the wedding (no wrinkles!). And the color was PERFECT for a Fall wedding. I got lots of compliments and felt very pretty!',\n",

In order to play “Preacher’s Wife” I feel like I had to step up my game.\\n\\nAfter dressing like a disgruntled office worker to the first wedding I attended as an adult, I’ve spent years attempting to undo this mistake with mostly vintage dresses or rewearing the same few Dillard's jams over and over, desperately trying to style them into something fresh. Enter RTR and this lil beauty.\\n\\nPROS: GORGEOUS detail. Lace for days. Great length for a formal affair where you don’t want to show your lady business. Beautiful open back and delicate chest detail. Love the two pintucks on the front. Also really fun to style—it’s somewhat conservative on the body but took really kindly to punk and vintage styling. Tons of compliments! Looks pretty with pearls as well. AWESOME to dance in. Both top and bottom parts of the dress let you move without anything falling out.\\n  \\nCONS: I’m gifted in the booty department, so I was a little bummed to not have a more defined bum. The waist was defining but not as dramatic as I would have liked. I also have a smaller chest and found that I needed to wear a bra just to add some oomph to the top. The lace also may snag on a friend’s dangly earrings or a purse chain, so watch out! \\n\\nHMM: There’s a bustier / inlay whose inner clasp was broken when it arrived, but I was able to make it work without it!\\n\\nI’m still giving this thing a 5/5 because I loved my RTR experience and I see this dress in my dreams. We already miss each other. Come back to me, Shoshanna dress. \",\n",

It is the most flattering dress, in the most FANTASTIC color. I ended up wearing the size 8R (though I'm usually 6R) and it fit perfectly - I cannot emphasize enough how flattering this dress is, it hugs in all the right places but then the lining helps skim over any anxiety-areas. N.b. there's no way to wear a bra or spanx (the side cuts are quite wide), however that really wasn't a problem as the fabric is strong enough to hold everything together. \\nOverall, 10/10 - I wish I could have bought it!\",\n",

(I needed two different dresses for my multi-day event, and my first choice was not able to be rented to me due to its condition upon return from the previous renter.) It is very beautiful, the fabric is quite thick and the train in the back gives it a solid feel. The fabric also flows quite nicely when you walk. I was pleased when I received it. I was happy that the petite length worked for me with a 2\" heel, but I was ultimately unable to wear the dress due to the bodice. I am very large busted and have to be able to wear either a full bra or at least a strapless bra. This dress has an open back. I tried to wear sticky bra supports but they did not stay on and therefore did not work for me. I could not wear this dress comfortably without a bra. I would have had to wear this dress on stage and did not feel confident I presented properly with no breast support by going braless. It is not conducive to braless wear for large busted women. Unless you want your bra strap to show across your back or your breasts to hang down to your waist (without a bra), this is not the dress for you.',\n",

I also felt very comfortable in the material. I was glad I rented the bigger jewelry I did because it helped with the front of the dress.

When the dress arrived, it fit great, however it ended up being a little TOO sparkly for my event. The wedding was black tie casual, however I was a guest of my boyfriends, and felt it would have drawn too much attention. I would DEFINITELY rent this for a New Years Eve, or holiday cocktail party, it would be perfect for that type of occasion, especially if you do not like to draw lots of attention! Fit great, low cut V-neck and nicely fit throughout hips, waist etc. ',\n",

This dress fit snugly in the bust, waist, and hips. As I get a tad bloated after eating/drinking, this dress did show this by the end of the night. So I would not recommend to someone trying to hide the belly. I did not wear a bra nor spanx with the dress, as the material is very sensitive in the rear, and would have shown the spanx outline, so I decided to take them off. There is built in wiring/lining in the waist and bust. \\nCustomer service was extremely helpful.

The sequins are not overly gaudy - they seem the shimmer in the light! And the slit on the side is sexy but not too high. As others have mentioned, it is a big snug in the midsection, and runs a bit short. I ordered the 0L and 2L, and ended up wearing the 0L. I'm only about 5'5, but with my 4 inch heels, the regular would have been too short. The long worked perfectly! The midsection was a little tight, which is why I wanted the size 2 as a backup. The bust, however, is a big large for someone with a small chest, like me. I would have worn the 2L had the bust not been big on me. My advise is order a size up as backup, but if you are small in the bust, you may end up sticking with your usual size. It really is a lovely dress, and I highly recommend renting it!\",\n",

The boning in the torso was uncomfortable as the night went on, but that was my only fit issue - I didn't even have to wear a bra, which was a nice surprise because that just doesn't happen for me with 32DDs. I think I was thrown off by the high-low skirt, which isn't my favorite cut, but I thought it worked for this style. Maybe I wanted the skirt to be a little fuller? It sort of looked like it was hanging there. Overall, it was a fun summer dress, and I'm glad I tried it.\",\n",

I chose to not wear a bra with this gown because of the open back, but you could definitely use a seamless adhesive bra or silicone coverups for extra comfort and concealment.

My only gripe (which is why there are four stars and not five) is that it's low cut. Like, crazy low cut. So low cut that I don't know how anyone wears it without pinning it or double sided tape. My tape actually started to give right before the interview, so I had to pull the back up with a hair tie at last minute.

The straps on the under dress are a little too long for me, so if there was a “short” size I bet it would be perfect.  The under dress straps drooped all day, but the cardigan hid it.

The top part was snug in the rib cage area, so I opted to go up a size. It was nice that you could wear a strapless bra underneath (although I didn't even bother since the dress was snug, secure, and thick enough to go without).

No bra or chest support necessary, \"the girls\" were supported by the tight waist and fitted chest area of the dress. ',\n",

Here's the catch-if you are busty at all, this is probably not the dress for you.  I am ordinarily a size 4 and asked for the 6 as a backup.  It's a good thing I did because I barely got the zipper up on the 4 in the chest.  It fit beautifully everywhere else but absolutely squashed my chest.  I had to wear the 6 and even that was a bit snug in the chest.  Unfortunately it was big everywhere else.  The 6 made my bottom half look much bigger than it did in the 4.  All in all it worked out but it would have been an over the top home run if the top were more proportionate to the bottom.  I can honestly say that this has never happened to me before so I do not feel like it's me.  If you are a B or less this is probably a perfect choice.   \",\n",

There is a silicon strip at the top of the dress to help it stay in place, but the strip on the dress I received was partially worn away so I was tugging it up more often that I think is normal for that dress. Also, the zipper eye-clasp faced inward, so I had a few scratches on my side from the clasp rubbing against my skin. ',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'I wore this out for my birthday....great outfit for early spring time in Michigan.  I am 5\\'9\" and wore the size 6 - which fit beautifully, but was tight when I sat down for dinner.  I had small red marks on the tops of my shoulders when I took the jumper off - but well worth the wear anyhow!  A small price to pay for how good I felt the rest of the evening.  The zipper is difficult if you need to use the restroom alone, but I was able to manage it solo.  I am typically a 36C in a VS bra, but the top on this jumper is very tight, and held everything in place the way I needed it to, so I did not need to wear a bra (which is not usual for me, I typically need one).  The cut outs are sexy, yet sophisticated - the outfit has a commanding presence to it, which I loved as well!  ',\n",

They are really an in between color, and will go with either gold or silver accessories. I wore it with gold accessories and nude/beige shoes. If you are going to have trouble with the fit of this dress it will probably be the top. I found the top to be a little too big around the shoulders, even when I wore the smaller of my two selected sizes. The dress is tighter around the bust but larger in the shoulders. Probably difficult to fit perfectly for a lot of body types. Both the 8 and the 10 fit but the 10 was really too big on top and you could see the edge of my bra through the arm hole. The 8 was still a little gappy and I was going to try to fix it with fashion tape. But I ran out of time trying to get the fashion tape right and ultimately I think it was fine to wear as it was.',\n",

I wore this for a date night out while in FL and received tons of compliments. It was easy to move around in and was totally comfortable all evening. It was brand new with the tags on it when I received it which was a nice bonus! It was dressy and classy enough for a summer wedding, but also would work for something less formal.

The only downside to my  experience was that the size 0 came without the liner, had a rip in the mesh in a very noticeable place, and was strangely too large on me compared to the 2. (The 0 was larger in the arm openings and length, as well as the waist hitting lower... Maybe it was mismarked?) Thankfully the 2 fit like a 2 should and was in great condition. It was very comfortable to wear and I got more compliments than I could count, which is saying a lot at a wedding of 25 people. I agree with the stylist notes: keep shoes and accessories simple with this fabulous dress. I wish I owned it and would probably rent again.

       "  'review_text': \"Overall, I loved this dress and I thought it flattered me very well.  But there were a couple of small things that made the dress a strange fit.  \\n1. The bust area is extremely loose.  It is simply two flaps that cross over each other so if you're not a full D cup (I'm a size 12-14 and am a 36 C) the flaps will sag open and you will show your undergarments.  I had to safety pin the front in two places so that it would stay close and unfortunately was self-conscious about it throughout the night (especially while dancing).\\n2. Because of the way the dress is designed, the hem is uneven if the bust is not filled out.  If the front starts to sag (which it did for me) it causes the whole dress to shift longer in the front and pulls up the back.  Being 5'10, I specifically rented a dress that was long on some shorter girls.  However, because the dress kept shifting to the front, I had to continually pull the dress down in the back because it kept riding up and getting shorter and shorter.\\n3. The material is surprisingly clingy and if you are fuller on bottom, it shows every line.  I would recommend a body shaper that allows a smooth line all the way from the waist to the thigh area (a leotard shape that just sucks in your tummy will cause a significant panty line).\\n\\nThe dress is stunning and flattering to curvy figures.  It just needs some adjustments to make it the perfect fit.\",\n",

It\\'s a little peek-a-boo without being too much AND since the cut out is higher on the back, a bra can easily be worn. I wore a strapless but after the fact I realized I could have worn a regular bra and it would have been fine... oh well!

I got the 12 L and it was long enough for me to wear 3 inch heels for an effect similar to the model photo - the back of the train swept the floor and my shoes peeked out just a bit in the front.

       "  'review_text': 'The fit of this gown was spot on. I am usually a size 12-10. Depending on the brand. I ordered a 10L with a 12L as back up. The size 10 fit like a glove. As you can see, the 10L was actually a little short. The 12L was EVEN SHORTER, ;like 4 inches shorter (bizarre). I\\'m not all that tall. About 5\\'7\" in bare feet. My heels brought me up to about 5\\'11\" and the 10L still didn\\'t graze the ground (the 12L was UNWEARABLY short! Seriously, I almost wish I\\'d gotten the XL). \\n\\nI was very happy with how this dress hugged my curves. I have a very true hourglass figure, with just a bit of a tummy. This draping on this dress concealed EVERYTHING! I\\'m not kidding! It also helped with my \"less than perfect\" arms. \\n\\nThis dress has a good amount of stretch. The only thing I wasn\\'t crazy about was the amount of layers. The pictures don\\'t really showcase that the bottom has three layers: one stops right at your bum (so be careful if you are bottom heavy -- it will cut into you), the second helps show less leg behind the slit, and the top lies as you would expect. \\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this dress. It was very comfortable and it didn\\'t feel too heavy. I am big busted (36DD-36DDD) and I was able to wear a Spanx singlet and a normal bra. \\n\\nOverall, I would definitely re-rent this dress for a different occasion. I would especially recommend this dress for any event that is taking place in a ballroom or a hotel (which are notoriously COLD). I was comfortable throughout the event, while many of my friends complained of being cold. ',\n",

It was actually a bit loose in the top for me, so if you are small-chested I would recommend wearing a sticky bra to fill it out a bit more (I just forgot mine). \\nI wore about 3-inch heels and it was JUST long enough - so if you are tall or like wearing high heels I'd recommend a long.

I had to get the size 0 because the 2 wasn't available, and while it fit everywhere else, it only hit me mid-thigh and I am slightly shorter than 5' tall. Definitely not church-appropriate and I am not even sure I would have worn it to something like a wedding, because it was tight enough that it crept up when I walked and I think by the end of a night with drinks, it would have been a bit much. I'd rent it again for something like a wedding or a Derby event, but I'd order a size up. The other thing I wasn't crazy about was that the exposed zipper is large and will not lay flat, so your backside looks lumpy from the side. Just sort of tight and short overall, so I'd order a size up. \",\n",

I have hips and a butt, so I chose to size up and wear the 6 instead of the 4, just so I could drink and eat that night, but the 4 fit very similarly (just a smidge snugger on the hips). The pockets are always a plus and the material was super soft (felt like a brushed cotton). It also had a stretch to it, which also added to the comfort level. The sleeves weren\\'t too tight, also, and I have slightly more muscular arms for my size. Overall, a great dress you can wear to a work event, a wedding or a party! ',\n",

When you are standing it looks great, just be careful where you sit down.  I probably wouldn't rent this dress for a wedding because of how short it gets when you sit down, but for the event I went to I didn't sit down very long so it was fine.

It was a little big on me, but that's because I've been losing weight and overestimated the size, but it still hung very nicely and look radiant. The color is lovely. It's stretchy fabric, sturdy construction. I wasn't hot even though the wedding was outside. I could dance in it. I wore spanx and they didn't show because the hem is nice and low. I paired with nude wedge heels and they looked great. No jewelry needed. The dress is the statement. Lots of compliments from strangers. Made me feel fancy at a very fancy wedding. \",\n",

The open back was awesome (loved the draping) and a really cool way to show some skin, but that was the only thing that was really working for me. The straps were very thick and tight on my shoulders, and the bust was extremely small - not a problem I've ever had to face before haha! I would hesitate to try this again in a size up for fear of it slipping out of place - was quite low cut, so I wore petals instead of a bra. I unfortunately had to continually adjust while wearing, but I'm sure this would look fabulous on another lady! I definitely recommend sizing up.

       "  'review_text': \"This was my first choice for attending a beach wedding - ironically I fit in with the wedding theme perfectly - but I should've guessed - the brides favorite color is yellow and that's the only reason I wore this dress.  This is not my typical style and I don't usually wear bright colors - but I got SOOOO many compliments.  The dress was a little on the loose side, and up until the day of the wedding I was going to wear my backup (which was a little too formal for a beach wedding) but then my friends talked me out of it and told me this dress looked really great.   PROS: pockets, love the damn pockets - perfect dress for a beach wedding\\nCONS:  I tend to be a little flatter on top, so if I had brought a padded bra with me or if I naturally had a larger chest then I think this dress would have felt like it fit perfectly.  \\nOne thing I would like to point out, I was under the impression when I rented the dress that this was a backless dress - but it's not (at all).  Completely fine to wear a bra with this dress - no special bra needed.  I would recommend this dress for others, but for me I will probably not rent it again since yellow isn't my color anyway :)\",\n",

I wasn't sure what others were wearing, as it was an evening dinner and dance, and this was a great choice - simple, classy and dressy without going overboard. The arm/neck details were a nice touch and I got many compliments.  Initially was not thrilled about the long, exposed, gold zipper in the back, but it felt fine and I wore a nice pair of rose-gold earrings with a pink topaz stone that looked amazing. The size 2 was comfortable and a little bit looser, but would be great for work or an evening work event. I will definitely rent this dress again!\",\n",

I don't think ordering from a mobile devise works as great as doing it from a  computer as I ordered a size 6 for my backup, but when the order completed, it was not in the cart.) The 4 fit like a glove. It would have been perfect except I couldn't take a few steps without the skirt hiking/riding up. I felt self conscious tugging it down continuously. So if you plan to do a lot of walking, dancing, etc., I would advise you to go one size up. I think I would have been more comfortable with a 6. Overall, though, this is a very eye-catching dress.

RTR was out of my backup size 8 and I think that may have gone a little better, but just been larger in the waist.

Secondly, it\\'s cozy without being terribly hot. Because of the winter-like pattern of the dress fabric, I picked it for a winter holiday party, which usually means being chilly through the event because your coat over in the coat check. Not this time! Bare shoulders and arms but still comfy- but never too hot or sweaty. The fabric has a good weight to it without being too heavy. The dress just feels substantial. It almost feels like you are just carrying a nice throw/blanket around with you all night. The bottom of the skirt poofed nicely and the bodice fit perfectly. I had my 3rd baby 8 mo ago and am never sure of my size right now, but surprisingly fit into the 10L (170ish lbs and 5\\'10\") but I do not have a big bust or rib cage. Rented a punk rock style statement necklace to tone down the Queen Elsa vibe the dress may give off. Worked out fantastically. I felt wonderful and received many compliments from strangers (which is very nice of them). ',\n",

I received several compliments--but the best one was from the bride herself because she is a fashionista! She said she had rented her dress for the rehearsal dinner from RTR, too! A couple of notes to share...The dress runs small (in my opinion) because it is so fitted in the bodice and hip area. I usually wear a size 6, but wore the size 8 and it was perfect. You need to buy a backless/strapless bra for this dress because the ivory lace back and inset on the front are see through. It's a sweet sexy detail, and you don't want bra straps showing! The color is a lovely muted blush rose color, and it blended perfectly with my daughters' dress (in photo). I wore this dress with Jessica Simpson nude platform pumps. Overall, it was a nice choice for this wedding event. \",\n",

       "  'review_text': 'I was a little disappointed when I received this dress. I ordered it to attend an opera auction, and when it came I almost went and purchased a dress. I had ordered an 8L and a 10L. I am only 5’7 but I usually wear at least a three inch heel with no platform. I ended up wearing the 10L even though I typically wear an 8, because the 10 hung better. I was unimpressed with the fabric, which I felt detracted from the quality of the dress. It was a slinky mesh material, so you could see every bump underneath it. I didn’t wear any undergarments because of that. I didn’t feel the dress was overly flattering on my body type. I have a wide rib cage, broad shoulders, big chest, and small waist. Despite how uncomfortable I felt in the dress or how I felt it looked on me, I received more compliments on that dress than I have ever before on any purchase.  I had men coming up to me saying the dress was stunning. The auctioneer referred to me as the “stunning lady in red” after I won a bid. Women approached me to tell me how gorgeous I looked. One woman said I looked like Anjelica Huston and another said Jessica Rabbit. Bottom line is the dress was a show stopper and very glamourous. It is also very comfortable to wear. ',\n",

I'm on the shorter, ~curvier~ side, and was looking for something colorful, cute, and conservative-ish for a pretty traditional church wedding. I love that this dress has a high neckline so I didn't have to worry about unwanted cleavage - sometimes you want the cleav, and sometimes you're in a church with a bunch of people you don't know and their grandmothers. The dress is comfortable, and the color is pretty and bright without being obnoxious. As another user mentioned, you will want a racerback bra (or no bra if you can), as the front of the dress cuts in a bit and the sides of my bra sometimes peeked through. The dress has those handy straps inside to hold your bra straps in, but there is a slight risk of side-bra exposure. Not terrible, but something to be aware of. Overall, I loved this dress and would rent again.\",\n",

The 4L was about four inches longer than the 2L which you can see still hit the floor even though I was wearing four inch heels (not pumps).  The 4L also came without a zipper pull on top so I contacted customer service and decided to wear the 2L. The material has stretch so it hugs even the straightest of figures, I do not really have hips and my butt is fairly small, but it looked cute (I don't have a picture) I loved that I could wear a normal bra and thong with this dress. The material is high quality so it is not see through and is heavy enough that I don't recommend wearing it in the summer sun, however it is the perfect weight for inside events! I was able to dance all night, sit comfortably, and breathe in this dress without it stretching out. I paired it with sparkly drop earrings, a center French braid and slicked back pony tail up-do, and a sparkly bracelet to keep it simple. I wore lace up heels with laser cut-outs that peeked out of the back slit when I walked and danced.\",\n",

I did find the armpit area to be a little tight but that's because I have a very broad chest/shoulder area.

       "  'review_text': \"Ok, this dress is stunning. The fabric could not be prettier (it's a neoprene material, by the way). The pros are exactly how beautiful it is, that it is really warm for winter, and it has an overall very flattering fit. It is rather short by the way, so dark thighs may be a necessity. It has some cons though. The first one is that it has a weird fit in the arms. The opening between shoulder and arm is rather large, but then the fabric compresses the arm itself. So, it accommodates a thicker arm around the shoulder, but not at the biceps area. This was annoying, and I felt pretty uncomfortable wearing it because of that. Two other cons, which are no big deal: the sleeves are really long. It's ok for wearing it standing up, but if you need your hands at all you will have to bring the sleeves up, which is not very easy to do with this dress, and also loses part of  its charm. The second is that the dress is warm indeed, so you will feel hot if you are either walking a lot, dancing or just being at a warm enough venue. One thing which may interest some: I was 6 months pregnant when I wore it, and it does not compress the belly at all. I was quite comfortable there in spite of the bump, my discomfort was all because of the arms. \",\n",

The fabric is pretty heavy and does not allow for much stretch, and for that reason I would say this style works best for A to C bust sizes.  With the one shoulder look on this gown, I would suggest going with a strapless bra.  The natural waist is definitely very fitted, but it did allow comfortable room throughout the midsection.  I would suggest sizing up for fuller hips as that area is definitely quite fitted.  The one shoulder sleeve was definitely a bit tight on my broader shoulders, so that\\'s definitely something to keep in mind.  At 5\\'7\"  this hit right at the bottom of the floor without heels so I would definitely suggest a long length for women my height or taller.

The boning ends just at your natural waist and was pretty uncomfortable so after a long night of dancing I ended up with a scab on my hip where the boning rubbed.

However, the thin strip of material around the center of the waist was pretty uncomfortable. The rest of the dress fits true to size in the bust, hip/butt area, and thighs, but for some reason the strip between the lace sections felt tight to me all night. It's not a deal breaker for me, but take note of this and maybe consider sizing up. \",\n",

       "  'review_text': 'I wore this for a black tie wedding in December. I wanted a dress that was conservative and elegant. This was a great choice because while it was modest and classy, there were a few details that made this a little playful and sassy: the sequins up top, the silky pleated skirt, and the crop look with illusion mesh. Some dresses make you work to wear them, but this dress isn\\'t! It\\'s like wearing that comfy sweater - where you don\\'t have to worry about bra straps sticking out, sheer material for an oops moment, too long trails, etc - but you still get to look fabulous. \\n\\nFor sizing, I think I could have even gone down one size as my waist is more petite, and that area is the most fitted area of the dress. However, I was happy with the size I got.\\n\\nFor dress length - I am 5\\'7\", wore 3\" heels with no platform height in the front. The SR dress fell about 2 inches from the ground. ',\n",

I didn't have much extra room in the torso, so while it was comfortable to wear to a theater show, I'm not sure how comfortable I would have been dancing or doing something requiring bending over, reaching, etc. without giving myself a wedgie! I needed help zipping and unzipping this, but there was a really nice lady in the bathroom who unzipped me then waited for me so she could zip me back up! The sleeves are very long and bunched up at the wrists a bit. There are no button holes, so I used the holes in the lace to push the buttons through. I played with turning the sleeves under for a hidden cuff, and that worked too. It is also very low cut and so I ultimately wore it with cami underneath (one pic has cami, the other one doesn't).

I'm a 32DDD so I'm always nervous about sizing/fit but the 6R fit nicely and the adjustability of the open back helped. The 4R fit as well but the straps were defective...it was one combined strap as opposed to two separate straps. You need two straps in order to loop through the back and I didn't want to cut the strap. Very odd but overall lovely dress! \",\n",

As the event planner, I am constantly moving around and I am one of the people that starts dancing first so, that others would be encouraged to do so as well. The jumpsuit was a great alternative to a cocktail dress and allowed me to move with ease -- not to mention I was the only one wearing a jumpsuit so, it stood out nicely in a sea of dresses especially when paired with a statement necklace. The jumpsuit was true to size; however, the it was a little long so, heel height is key or fashion tape for the hem. The material also wrinkled easily which was a con for me. Overall this jumpsuit fits better than most and the material is most similar to crepe so, it did not add warmth, but kept me warmer than I would have been if I opted to wear a dress. The jumpsuit on the model looks more like a bordeaux color,  but in reality it was more on the purple side than  red.',\n",

I got this as my back up dress and only size 6 was available but I figured I'd order it since it was only my back up and I had a few post-baby pounds left over. (I thought the 6 would be big but the dress runs small and was very form fitting. I wore Spanxx.)   I wound up returning my other dress and wearing this one. Perfect for a formal wedding because the sequin are subtle and the cut out in the back is tasteful (I'm usually super conservative so this was fun and adventurous to wear. I felt great!) I was able to wear a strapless bra with it (the first strapless bra I tried peeked out the back so try on multiple ones before you give up.) I wore bronze peep toe shoes & very minimal jewelry. The sequin did not irritate my arms like some users said. The slip does show on the bottom a little but I didn't mind. Overall, great dress if you want to step out of your comfort zone & have a little fun!\",\n",

It was more or a salmon or peachy pink color than rose, but gorgeous none the less. I was afraid the L would be too big (only size available when I rented). However, it was perfect! The top is also pretty long, I decided to tuck it in to give myself some definition. It was perfectly flouncy and light light weight. The top also did not wrinkle very easily, which makes it great to wear all day or too a party. ',\n",

I didn't give it 5 stars b/c there was an issue with the zipper where the teeth were missing right where the waist seam was so it was almost impossible to zip. If my fiancé and friend hadn't helped me I never would have gotten it on. It definitely runs a little small in the best, but otherwise had a great fit. I got tons of compliments & it was very comfortable. Some of the dots in the pattern are salmon colored which was not clear from the photo but luckily it still looked good on my pale skin. Fabric is very thick so would not be good for outdoor event in summer but was great for an indoor event in March. Overall a good dress! \",\n",

The dress is stretchy, but form filling and fit like a glove.  The only issued I had was the straps were too long.  This was easily remedied by joining the straps with a small hair barrette at the base of my neck which I covered with my hair.  If I were to order again in the future, I would try out the 6.  I highly recommend this dress.  It is a beautiful color and very comfortable. I was able to wear a strapless bra with it by pulling the strap down low in the back.\",\n",
